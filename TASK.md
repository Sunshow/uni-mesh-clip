## Completed Tasks
- Created project structure and initialized Tauri 2.0 - 2025-07-08
- Set up PLANNING.md with architecture details - 2025-07-08
- Created TASK.md for tracking development - 2025-07-08

## Discovered During Work
- Need to create icon assets for system tray
- Consider adding notification support for sync events
- May need to handle clipboard format conversion between platforms
- Should add connection retry logic with exponential backoff

## Critical Bug Fixes - 2025-07-08
- [x] **FIXED: Start button spinning issue** - 2025-07-08
  - Root cause: Clipboard initialization blocking due to macOS permissions
  - Root cause: WebSocket server not properly releasing ports on stop
  - Solution: Added 5-second timeout for clipboard initialization
  - Solution: Implemented proper WebSocket server shutdown mechanism
  - Solution: Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Solution: Fixed state management race conditions
  - Solution: Added detailed logging for debugging
  - Result: Start button now responds within 5 seconds maximum
  - Result: Proper port cleanup allows restart without "address in use" errors
  - Result: App continues working even if clipboard permission denied

## Core Synchronization Implementation - 2025-07-08
- [x] **COMPLETED: Phase 3 - Core Synchronization** - 2025-07-08
  - Implemented UUID-based message deduplication system with time-based cleanup
  - Added bidirectional clipboard sync with loop prevention
  - Created robust error handling with retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
  - Implemented comprehensive sync metrics tracking (sent/received/failed messages)
  - Added connection recovery and graceful degradation on clipboard failures
  - Enhanced WebSocket message processing for incoming clipboard updates
  - Integrated clipboard monitoring with sync state management
  - Result: Full bidirectional clipboard synchronization working across devices
  - Result: Robust error handling prevents sync loops and handles failures gracefully
  - Result: Comprehensive metrics provide visibility into sync operations

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Set up development environment files
3. Create README with setup instructions
4. Begin implementing WebSocket server functionality
